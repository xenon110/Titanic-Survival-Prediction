## 📖 Project Overview

The **Titanic Survival Prediction** project is a classic **binary classification** problem, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, class, fare, and more.

This project is structured as follows:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 🧹
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
- Feature Engineering 🛠
- Model Building & Evaluation 🤖
